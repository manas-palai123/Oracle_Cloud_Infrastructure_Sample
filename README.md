# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Sample Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation sample for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The sample includes the creation of a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), a compute instance, and an object storage bucket using OCI's Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites

1. **OCI Account:** You need access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account.
2. **OCI CLI:** Install and configure the OCI Command Line Interface. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm).

## Steps to Run

### 1. Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN):

```bash
oci network vcn create --cidr-block "10.0.0.0/16" --display-name "MyVCN" --compartment-id <your-compartment-id>
```
### 2. Create a subnet within the VCN:
```bash
oci network subnet create --vcn-id <your-vcn-id> --cidr-block "10.0.0.0/24" --display-name "MySubnet" --compartment-id <your-compartment-id>
```
### 3. Create a compute instance:
```bash
oci compute instance launch --availability-domain "<your-availability-domain>" --compartment-id <your-compartment-id> --display-name "MyInstance" --shape "VM.Standard2.1" --subnet-id <your-subnet-id> --image-id <your-image-id> --ssh-authorized-keys-file <path-to-ssh-public-key>
```
### 4. Create an Object Storage Bucket:
```bash
oci os bucket create --compartment-id <your-compartment-id> --name <your-bucket-name>
```
### 5. Upload your file in Object Storage Bucket:
```bash
oci os object put --bucket-name <your-bucket-name> --file <path-to-local-file> --name <object-name-in-bucket>
```
## Additional Information
1. Always refer to the official Oracle Cloud documentation for detailed and up-to-date information.
2. Feel free to customize and extend the implementation based on your specific use case.
